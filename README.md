🛠️ This is a beginner-friendly command-line tool for interacting with the Gemini API, with a focus on AI integration and communication via the terminal.

📦 The goal of this project is to practice:
	•	Making API calls in Python
	•	Reading and modifying existing files using AI

⚠️ Warning: This is a learning project and not production-ready. It lacks security measures—particularly around what the AI can overwrite. Use at your own risk!

🚧 Still under development – built as part of my deeper dive into Python and API management.
